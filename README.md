## üìå Introduction

The project, ***Learning Made Easy*** has been designed for the convenience of students who are planning for the preparation of any kind of examination. It will help them to understand how to study different subjects,  and the topics within them and how much time should they give to everything and keeps a track of their learning rate of each student and hence personalise their experiences as well, so that it can optimize the time assigned for learning each subject in future. It will help you build a deeper knowledge about Data Structure and Algorithms and understand their applications in our life in a more efficient manner. It aims at scheduling the studies for maximizing marks during exams. Most students face this problem during exams that what to study to get the best out of their limited time. Also it helps the early beginners to start with the most important subjects so that they have enough time for the most important subjects and then if time permits they can go ahead with less important subjects. Apart from this, it schedules the subjects as the way user wants to.

## ‚≠ê Steps to follow :scroll:

<br>


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Learning-Made-Easy](https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

<br>


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Learning-Made-Easy.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Learning-Made-Easy` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Learning-Made-Easy
$ cd Learning-Made-Easy
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Learning-Made-Easy.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Learning-Made-Easy.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [Learning-Made-Easy](https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Learning-Made-Easy.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Learning-Made-Easy.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Learning-Made-Easy` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https:/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy/github.com//pulls).

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the work on your local machine :computer:

To run the code and play with the app on your local machine, do:
* `if os == 'Windows'`:
  * We have tested the code in **Dev C++ IDE** and **Code Blocks IDE** **(Both running MINGW)**.
  * To run the code in any IDE, simply open the file, click `Execute > Run` [Click here for more instructions](http://cs.uno.edu/~jaime/Courses/2025/devCpp2025Instructions.html)
*  `if os == 'Linux or Unix or Mac'`:
   * You need to have `GCC` installed:
   * Go to the folder having the code(.cpp file).
   * Open the terminal, and type : `g++ -o test_prep test-prep.cpp`
   * Then run the script by typing : `./test_prep` 

<br>

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create seperate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a seperate branch for contibution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

<br>


### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Get Featured in the Contributor's List! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Finally, after your pull request has been merged, add another comment below the PR as follows

```sh
@all-contributors please add @<your_username> for <contributions>
```
In contributions, you need to type `code` if you have contributed to the code, or `documentation` if you 
contrubuted for the markdown files.

## ‚≠ê Language Used:

C++ 

<br>

## ‚≠ê Basic Functionalities:
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-responsibility.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

To schedule the exams for a very short period of time i.e. 1-2 days for the students who begin to study just before the day of the exam and complete syllabus in a very short time.

To schedule the exam time study for students subject wise who start their studies one or two week before the exams so they complete their syllabus of each subject in time.


To schedule the exam time study for students who begin to study quite early I.e. almost a month ago and have enough time to do everything in the syllabus. Also they have no time issue.



<br>

## ‚≠ê Algorithm used:

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-brains.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Fractional Knapsack Algorithm: Fractional Knapsack algorithm is used in order to find the chapters to be done on the basis of their weightage so as to maximize marks in limited amount of time.

Job Scheduling Algorithm: This algorithm is implemented so that the user inputs the subjects he/she has to study with the date of exams of the respective subjects and respective priorities. So they get the sequence of subjects as ouput for effective ways of study and managing time.


<br>

## ‚≠ê Real Life Application: 
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/makes-people-smile.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) <br>
A most common problem faced by students during exams is of time management and its utilization.It can help students to effectively manage their time during exams by giving them a sequence in which the should study in order to maximize marks.
